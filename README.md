React Shopping Cart Test
I automated a shopping cart website using Selenium tool, Cucumber BDD framework and java programming language.
This website automates several functionalities of web pages which includes:
1)testing of drop down button
2)checking the count of star ratings
3)checking if cart selects the desired products and adds to cart with correct quantity.
4)checking if button colour is amber green
5)product quantity for different cloth size must displayed according to availability
<br>
All the webpages are designed in page object modelling format(POM) with assertion and has 1 feature file with 8 scenarios
The Automation is run on parallel test mode and executes the whole process in less than 10 seconds with the extent report.
